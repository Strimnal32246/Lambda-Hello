Hello My name is Susan Trimnal. I am loyal, honest, and caring. My favorite hobbies are camping, fishing, playing video games. I enjoy anything on the computer. I have chickens in my backyard and baby chicks. I also have 4 dogs. I have 3 cats. I like to go on to google plus sometimes and on linkdin. Another that I go onto is goodreads. I enjoy reading books depending on what mood I am is what subject I will read.
